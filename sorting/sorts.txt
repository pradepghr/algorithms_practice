1. quicksort: implement it, explain it
2. mergesort: implement it, talk about space complexity as well as time complexity
3. insertion sort: explain when it can be better than the above two
4. heapsort: explain how it works, and how heaps work in general
5. bubble sort: why it's awful
6. radix/counting/bucket sort: when it's useful
7. selection sort: usually thrown in as an example when asked to list sorting algorithms you know
